    "### Benefits of using NumPy\n",
    "- Even though Python lists are great on their own, NumPy has a number of advantages over them.\n",
    "1. It is faster than Python lists. When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists.\n",
    "- This is due to the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algoriths used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It has multidimensional array data structures that can represent vectors and matrices. For example, when training a Neural Network, you often have to carry out many matrix multiplications. Numpy is optimized for these operations and allows for Linear Algebra operations effectively and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It has a large number of optimized built-in mathematical functions for a variety of complex mathematical computations."
